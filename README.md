# Welcome to Xehker!

This is the feeble dream of a mad developer trying to make an immersive, scary post-apocalyptic Exile server.

This map is on Esseker, using my own mod pack. Feel free to submit pull requests but keep in mind, I have very little time to develop on this server and I'm doing it very slowly. If you find a bug or would like to request something be added, go ahead and make a ticket.
